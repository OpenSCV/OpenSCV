OpenSCV is a new hierarchical taxonomy for Smart Contract vulnerabilities. It is open to community contributions and matches the current state of the practice while being prepared to handle future modifications and evolution. The taxonomy was built based on the analysis of existing research on vulnerability classification, community-maintained classification schemes, and smart contract vulnerability detection.

OpenSite is available at the  https://openscv.dei.uc.pt/.
